Hailed from San Antonio, TX and born on a cold winter in 2019, In a Darkened Room, comprised of 3 members, began crafting a lamenting sound scape that would echo the sorrow of uncertainty and self conflict. The band serves little slices of death and apathy with a languid sensuality. We strive to create music for people in a dark place..-In a Darkened Room.
