We had so much fun together this past year, we wanted to do it all over again.

These guys are amazing and if you haven’t seen them live, you should. One of the absolute best bands touring today.
Flawless musicians, the lot of them and excellently crafted songs to boot.

Astari Nite crosses an obscure mix between gothic rock and post-punk, exploring themes of death, love and the occult.
We enjoy their company as well as their music because they love puppies, creativity and the esoteric arts just like we do and they have a fine understanding that love is the law.

One of the coolest things about Dark Castle is that we all hang out together and you can too!

Check out Astari Nite on Bandcamp or wherever you choose to listen to music.
They can be found on all of the usual platforms.
Welcome back to Dark Castle Astari Nite, we’re excited to see you again!
