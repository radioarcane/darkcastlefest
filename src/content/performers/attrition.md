“The Great Derailer” has turned out to be a bit prophetic for the Attrition 2024 USA tour. Perhaps Martin and company should take up fortune telling.

We do hope they will be able to trudge through the unfortunate circumstances of this year and be able to return with renewed vigor and a better situation in 2025. We wish them the best and see this more as a delay than a cancellation. We will certainly stay in touch and, until then, let’s keep our dark castle fires burning! We’ll see you all soon!
