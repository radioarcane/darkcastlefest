We are extremely excited to announce a late addition to our festival -
Please welcome Attrition to Dark Castle Fest 2024!

Generally speaking, once we fill up, that’s a wrap. However, when a legendary artist so historically intertwined in the very fabric of what developed this culture we celebrate asks if we’d be interested, we just couldn’t say no. We had to make room.

For any unfamiliar, here is some background from their website-
“ATTRITION are pioneers in what became known as darkwave…Carving out a unique slice of the creative underground for over two decades, fueled by a succession of critically acclaimed albums…selling over 50,000 to date…the band has toured all Europe and North America, Mexico and Asia, appeared at major festivals and had their music included on a number of film soundtracks….

Formed in 1980 by Martin Bowes and Julia Waller in Coventry, England, influenced by a mix of punk ideology and experimental art aesthetics, they emerged as part of the early ’80’s UK Industrial scene alongside contemporaries Test Department, Coil, Legendary Pink dots, In The Nursery, Portion Control et al.
Their music is an undefinable marriage of dark and light…of futures and pasts…probing unexplored sonic landscapes with an eclectic marriage of experimental and traditional sound, of electronics and acoustics, of male and female….what became known as darkwave.”

You can check out Attrition on Bandcamp or wherever you choose to listen to music. Plenty of great tunes available on all of the usual platforms.
(Including our new Dark Castle Fest 2024 Spotify Playlist with all of the bands).

We are so excited to have Attrition be a part of Dark Castle Fest! You help make this event extra special!
