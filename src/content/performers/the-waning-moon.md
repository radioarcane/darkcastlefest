The Waning Moon is a traditional goth rock band comprised of vocalist and guitarist Ariel Maniki (from Ariel Maniki and the Black Halos), Zac Campbell (from the Kentucky Vampires) on lead guitars, Magali C on keyboards, and Ian Joseph (DJ Vampdaddy) on bass. The Waning Moon pays homage to the sounds of 90s traditional goth rock while maintaining their own sound with modern influences.
