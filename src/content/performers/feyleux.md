Feyleux will be joining Dark Castle Fest 2025 and we couldn’t be more thrilled to have them! We like them so much that we’re also having them at our annual Goth Prom on May 30th as well. That means you have a chance to see them twice this year and you should! 

Feyleux is a dark alternative duo that emerged in mid-2023 seamlessly blending dream pop, darkwave, and post-punk to create their distinct sound. Their debut album, "Midnight Hearts," released via the Swiss Dark Nights label, showcases cutting-edge bass synthesizers, cascading guitar melodies, and ethereal harmonies. Drawing on the vibrant gothic synth-pop aesthetics of the 1980s as well as modern darkwave.
