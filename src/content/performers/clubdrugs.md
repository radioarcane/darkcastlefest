This Goth Pop, Dark Wave band released their first couple of singles in June, 2022.

Aside from playing their hometown, they’ve done some show dates on the east coast and even once in Europe; but it looks like Dark Castle will be their first show south of the Ohio River. Lucky us that we get to be their first date on their way down Interstate 65. How should we welcome them to Kentucky? With bourbon, of course! Nothing goes better with sweet melodic hooks from a Moog Sub25 than some Old Forester 86! 86 + 25 = 111 and that sounds like some solid numerology right there.
“Seeing the angel number 111 signifies confidence within yourself and motivates your own strength and decision-making when opportunities are sent your way.”
Well, there you have it folks. It’s in the numbers!

You can check out clubdrugs on Bandcamp or wherever you choose to listen to music. They have music available on all of the usual platforms.
(Including our new Dark Castle Fest 2024 Spotify Playlist with all of the bands).
Welcome to Dark Castle clubdrugs, we’re excited about you!
