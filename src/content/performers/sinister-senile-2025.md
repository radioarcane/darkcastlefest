If you’re familiar with the local music and arts scene here in Louisville, you probably already know Kensaku Nishizato. He’s one of the sweetest and most supportive people most of us are ever lucky enough to meet in this world. Not only is he a creative marvel but he’s downright family to us and this community adores him.

In short, it’s no surprise we want Kensaku and his wonderful brothers (gems all) to be part of Dark Castle Fest again. Their performance last year is high on our list of magickal moments of creativity, authenticity and human expression. As a full band, you can truly feel each member’s deep connection to each other and their collective energy is downright healing to witness. If you vibe on the frequencies of the 93 or the 23, Sinister Senile gives a performance you’re likely to dial right in. 

“Sinister Senile is the journey of experimental electro-acoustic darkness that is approaching 30 years of sound.<br />
Primarily it has been a solo project lead by Kensaku Nishizato. Kensaku has collaborated with Nurse with Wound, Val Denham, Peat Bog, Norman Westberg & other artists from around the world. 

In 2024 Gary Mccracken, Robert John, Jerry Sutton, and Kirk Wilson joined Sinister Senile as it evolved into a magical ensemble.  Robin Storey of Rapoon is currently working with Sinister Senile on various tracks for its first release on vinyl slated for 2026.”
