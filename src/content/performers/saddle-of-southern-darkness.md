It’s been a goal to find ways to make Dark Castle Fest stand out as something unique within the dark music community.
No better way than to add a bit more authentic Appalachian flavor to our local, American Gothic experience.
Not in a typical way, though.
We want a bit of Nick Cave with our Bill Monroe.
A bit of folk magic and some Granny Witchcraft, instead of the standard traditions of gospel Bluegrass.
Real Dark Folk.

Saddle is a four piece rock show, curated with traditional aspects of folk and country sounds. Bringing you a unique stage performance rooted in percussive upright bass and propelled by dynamic drum application. Fronted by brothers, Chase and Trent Williams who bring to the stage a variety of instruments including; Electric Guitar, Pedal Steel, dobro, mandolin, banjo and acoustic guitar. The brothers take turn in sharing stories, with twangy vocals from harsh to clean, seamlessly, while complimenting one another with natural “blood harmony.”
These brothers aren’t faking anything, either. They are real farmers. They live off the land of Kentucky and they are genuine, good people with their own original recipe of farm fresh, dark country music.

Check them out on Bandcamp or wherever you choose to listen to music. They can be found on most of the usual platforms.
Anyway, welcome to Dark Castle kinfolk, we’re excited about you!
