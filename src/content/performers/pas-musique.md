Do you have a love for the history of this music culture? We do. We’ll try not to burden you with an overlong lecture and instead welcome in a piece of that tradition as we introduce Pas Musique and some roots lineage. If some of the personal names Robert Pepper has collaborated with don’t ring a bell for you, some of their affiliated projects should. Just do a quick search on Martin Bisi, for instance, or the legendary Z'EV.

Pas Musique has performed at Art Sanctuary a couple of times before and we always love it but this will be the first time at Dark Castle Fest and we can’t wait. Not only for the great music but also the high quality company of a terrific artist. Robert is a good guy. He’s been around. Knows about cool things.
