description: "FnP conjure their own genre-bending blend of gothic pop, post-punk & alternative cabaret. French-born vocalist Samantha Stephenson sings with a gothy heft and authority while former punk rock bassist turned guitarist, live looping master Scott Helland weaves his spidery electro/acoustic guitar melodies and cheeky garage noir riffage to perfectly complement Stephenson’s vocals."

What a joyous surprise it is to get to add Frenchy and the Punk to the Dark Castle Fest lineup this year! They cruised in on their steamboat just in the nick of time and we can’t wait to see them perform! You gotta come see this band because aside from being super talented, they are also a lot of fun.

Through their unmistakable blend of influences ranging from post-punk and dark folk to new wave and goth, Frenchy and the Punk have forged their own distinct path since 2005, touring across the US and Europe with their artful two-person powerhouse of sound.

Drawing inspiration from post-punk legends like The Cure, the upbeat energy and percussive textures of Adam and the Ants, the bewitching mystique of Siouxsie and the Banshees, and the quirky charm of The B-52's, they have crafted a sound that is both nostalgic and refreshingly authentic delivered in an unorthodox way.
The pair is proof positive that opposites really do attract. French-born singer/percussionist and former ballet dancer Samantha Stephenson, fronts the duo with her sultry yet powerful voice, often likened to iconic legends Siouxsie Sioux, Johnette Napolitano and Grace Slick. Coupled with the melodic electro/acoustic guitar stylings and looping mastery of her American-born partner and former hardcore punk bassist Scott Helland, the dynamic partnership is a force to be reckoned with. A real life love story against the backdrop of an unwavering dedication to the art of music and creativity as a lifestyle and personal journey.

You can check out Frenchy and the Punk on Bandcamp or wherever you choose to listen to music. Plenty of great tunes available on all of the usual platforms.
(Including our new Dark Castle Fest 2024 Spotify Playlist with all of the bands). We are so glad you’re a part of Dark Castle Fest Frenchy and the Punk! You help make this event extra special!
