The band Wireworks started in 2020 by Jake Miller, David Cundiff, Russell Willoughby, and Austin Hellman. After each member played in several music acts over the last three decades, the foursome connected with a mutual love for post-punk and darkwave music of the 80s and 90s. After a few rehearsals and practices, Wireworks was ultimately created. Wireworks released their self-titled debut release in May of 2021 which featured nine songs of all out post-punk and darkwave music. Both catchy and going from shoegaze to upbeat, the band continued to grow and broaden their sound. In 2022, Jake Miller reached out to synth/keyboardist Paul Chenault to join the band. With the addition of ambient and dreamy synths, they released two singles “Please Forget Me” and “Strangers Again” showcasing the full ensemble. Wireworks recently released a cover version of “Just You” from the infamous Twin Peaks series through Darkness Calling compilation benefiting The Trevor Project. Wireworks is now currently completing recording on their sophomore release expected to be out in 2023.
