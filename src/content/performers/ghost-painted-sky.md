description: "New England-based band creating dark, intense, introspective music, with a sound built upon the influence of the classic goth, post-punk, and darkwave sounds of the 80s and 90s."
seoDescription: "Introducing Ghost Painted Sky at Dark Castle Fest 2024, hailing from Massachusetts! Since 2014, this band has crafted atmospheric, melodic gloominess that fits Dark Castle perfectly. With webbing guitars, anchored bass, and tribal drumming, Ghost Painted Sky offers a Gothic sound firmly rooted in tradition. Featuring the dynamic interplay of a dark baritone male and an angelic female vocalist, their music seamlessly seeps into your subconscious, growing on you with each listen."

Ghost Painted Sky has been around since 2014 and has released several EPs, singles, and one full-length album so far, with a second full-length scheduled for 2024.
This was another band entry of immediate attraction. Their sound just fits Dark Castle perfectly. Atmospheric, melodic gloominess. Webbing guitars, well anchored bass, often with tribal drumming; two Yin and Yang vocalists, one dark baritone male and the other an angelic and beautiful female.

This band feels firmly rooted in a traditional Gothic framework and we love it. A+
One thing that stands out noticeably is how much their music seeps into your subconscious and grows on you in pleasant reflections. It gets catchier after a few listenings and you end up wanting more and digging in further.

Another band we highly recommend heading over to Bandcamp and buying a few things from but even if you’re not the buying kind, at least check them out wherever you choose to stream.

Anyway, welcome to Dark Castle Ghost Painted Sky, we’re excited about you!
