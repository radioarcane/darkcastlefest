Welcome Blood Dance, coming to us all the way from Mexico City, Mexico!

We are overjoyed to be able to host this band and get the rare opportunity to see them perform live here in Louisville. CDMX has a thriving Gothic scene and we are super excited to get to bring some of that here to Art Sanctuary. Adding one more reason you don’t want to miss this festival.

Blood dance is a Gothic Rock, Dark Wave band formed in Mexico City in 2016.
They have played with various international bands such as Hapax, Gitane Demone, Clan of Xymox, Spiritual Bat, Corpus Delicti, Plastique Noir, and many others.
Since 2019 they have released a series of singles with the help of Barry Galvin (Mephisto Walz, Scarlet Remains, Christian Death).
They have also had the privilege of collaborating with Fran Ka of Corpus Delicti for their most Recent Single "Blood Dance by Blood Dance".

You can check them out on Bandcamp or wherever you choose to listen to music. They can be found on all of the usual platforms.
Welcome to Dark Castle Blood Dance, we’re excited about you!
