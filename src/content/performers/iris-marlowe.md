Dark Castle Fest is elated to welcome Iris Marlowe to the lineup for 2024. We know there is a dark music festival happening about every week somewhere at this point, but Dark Castle is still unique. We like banjos and mandolins and cellos and even some slide guitar if it gets that expressive emotion we’re looking for.
Introducing Iris Marlowe, a Gothic Country band from Chicago, Illinois.

Iris Marlowe is an alternative-country singer songwriter that uses her love of classic country music to create cinematic songs that paint a southern gothic landscape. Her latest album ‘Where the Devil Bid the Owl Goodbye’ features songs driven by revenge, terror, and a yearning for the danger of the old west. Iris Marlowe creates country music for the eccentrics and folks that are looking for something a little creepier in the country music landscape.

We love this sound and hope you’re open to it, too. Nick Cave isn’t the only dark plunderer digging around in this rich history for that gem of deep expression that sometimes comes across strongest with an acoustic instrument.

You can check out Iris Marlowe on Bandcamp or wherever you choose to listen to music. Plenty of great tunes available on all of the usual platforms.
(Including our new Dark Castle Fest 2024 Spotify Playlist with all of the bands).
Welcome to Dark Castle Iris Marlowe, we’re excited about you!
