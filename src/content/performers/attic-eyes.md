Attic Eyes is an up and coming Dark Wave / Gothic project from Knoxville, Tennessee. They released their first single in June, 2022, a couple of others shortly afterwards and their first album this September, 2023. This self titled album has been a personal favorite on the old playlist ever since.

Believe us, this band has produced well crafted, very strong songs. With extremely powerful, emotive vocals reminiscent of (dare we say?) Pete Burns. Well, very early Pete Burns during the 7” Gothic era, before the fame. That’s a huge complement, in our opinions. Maybe even a dash of early Ian Astbury, which means powerful vocals as both Ian and Pete could wail. So can Attic Eyes vocalist Adam Deal.

The music is equally as solid with delicious guitar hooks by John Clercx and driving bass lines of the sort we crave by Travis Morgan. Morgan also handles the exceptionally tasteful electronics which accent and add to the songs rather than over powering their elegance.

This is no run of the mill dark project, this is old school talent across the board and we were instantly drawn to it and impressed. That’s why this band is first in. They rock and you should do yourself a favor and head on over to Bandcamp and buy this first album. It’s a gem.

Anyway, welcome to Dark Castle Attic Eyes, we’re excited about you!
