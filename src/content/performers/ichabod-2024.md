Very happy to announce that our old friend Ichabod will be trekking up for another joust with the decks at Dark Castle Fest!

Based in Nashville, TN, Ichabod is a DJ, promoter, event planner, and musician. He is both the founder and resident DJ of FASCINATION STREET, a monthly dance event and banner for concert promotion since 2013. Prior to that, he was a resident DJ for Salvation Gothic/Industral, The Asylum, and The Underground Nashville. He produces and hosts the monthly radio show/podcast "Out ov the Coffin" on Mixcloud, and serves as the Assistant Director of the Horror Track at Dragon Con, where he handles their Goth programming each year, as well as organizing and DJing the Open Casket Dance Party. He is also a songwriter and bass player involved in multiple music projects, the next face of which is forthcoming. Under all of that, he works a day job in multimedia, and in his spare time, tries to catch his breath.

You can check out some of Ichabodâ€™s spell work on Mixcloud from his show @outovthecoffin and follow on Instagram for regular updates.
