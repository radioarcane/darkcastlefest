The Neuro Farm will return to Dark Castle Fest in 2024! They were so great at Dark Castle in 2023 that we thought we needed more. Sometimes once just isnâ€™t enough. You know?
They just fit Dark Castle so well: the violin, the operatic vocals, the romantic flare of their atmosphere and style.
They have theatrical appeal, a dark, moody romanticism and a neoclassical edge to their Gothic styled music.
They just belong in our castle and we love them.
Plus, we bonded over the sweetness of puppies, kittle cats and our mutual love of mixed nuts and Louisville Vegan Jerky.
They have kind, gentle souls along with their mesmerizing audio projections and we just think everyone needs more.

The Neuro Farm is a darkwave, gothic rock band based in Washington DC. Combining vocal harmony with soaring violin melodies, driving rhythm guitar, and ethereal sonic textures, their music has been described as hauntingly beautiful.

Check them out on Bandcamp or wherever you choose to listen to music. They can be found on all the usual platforms.
Anyway, welcome back to Dark Castle friends, we're excited about you!
