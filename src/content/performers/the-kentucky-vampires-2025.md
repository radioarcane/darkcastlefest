We were uncertain if we could navigate the heavens to allow for yet another Dark Castle appearance by The Kentucky Vampires.
There is always something out there working against us…
But today, on May 30th, the day of the Louisville Goth Prom, the sun joins Mercury in Gemini — in a *Mercury Cazimi — marking a powerful moment for clarity, insight and mental breakthroughs.
This celestial conjunction shines a spotlight on our consciousness, inviting us to embark on an exciting journey of exploration. We are encouraged to seek out innovative paths, uncover fresh solutions, and embrace new perspectives.

Thus - 

The Kentucky Vampires are playing Dark Castle Fest 2025

The Kentucky Vampires are a Gothic Rock band founded in Louisville, Kentucky.
There have been some changes over the years but one thing has never changed-
The Kentucky Vampires play Gothic Rock.
The end.
