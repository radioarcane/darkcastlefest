Returning to Art Sanctuary by popular demand from Dark Castle 2023, we are excited to welcome back Dead Cool! This band is a whole lot of fun and brings the dance floor of our great hall some love with upbeat songs and awesome throwback synth melodies. They’re super nice as well and you should come out and meet them in person.

“From the coastal charm of Wilmington, North Carolina emerges intriguing electronic duo, Dead Cool. Their namesake, drawn from a Chrome Cranks number, resonates with the unique chemistry of Johnny’s multifaceted vocal, synthesizer, and guitar prowess, coupled with Angela Yeagher’s bass rhythms and harmonizing vocals. Infused with the evocative notes of darkwave, post-punk, and synthpop, Dead Cool’s musical offerings, established since 2020, have been garnering an enthusiastic following both domestically and internationally.”

Check out Dead Cool on Bandcamp or wherever you choose to listen to music.
