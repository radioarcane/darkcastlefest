Are you into visually exciting, avant-garde performances with live saxophone, theremin, trombone, live percussion, live played synth sequences and fresh, interesting weirdness from creative humans that blow your mind with imagination? Because we are and Oakland, California's haunted improv duo Bat Noise delivers!

Let’s welcome Bat Noise to Dark Castle! Our castle was made for bats and these fashionable flying puppies should fit right in.

They offer a live experience with urgency as ceremony, wear masks and give their all to their performance and musicianship.

Described as experimental, haunted and strange with industrial sequences that have a goth, deathrock, possessed channeling quality. They both sing, switching off lead vocals, and weaving spooky soundtracks with everything besides a few samples performed live.

Roxy Monoxide and LuLu Gammaray can also be found in their other projects Moira Scar and V.E.X.

V.E.X. was a Roxy and LuLu duo that is now called Bat Noise. Bat Noise is also where Moira Scar, V.E.X. and Bat Noise release music and put on underground events. Moira Scar/V.E.X. has played many hundreds of shows, including with Psychic T.V., 45 Grave, HIDE, Hante, Moor Mother, Gitane Demone, Acid Mothers Temple, Lydia Lunch, Skeletal Family, Spiritual Bat, Kommunity FK, Mephisto Walz, SRSQ, Blu Anxxiety, and many more.

Check them out on Bandcamp or wherever you choose to listen to music. They can be found on all the usual platforms, though, currently under the other names.
They are due to release some new stuff as Bat Noise soon but we already know it will be fun.
Anyway, welcome to Dark Castle Bat Noise, we’re excited about you!
