We felt our Appalachian spellwork could use a bit of Rocky Mountain witchcraft!
It only felt proper to invite our friends WitchHands to fly in and help us fill things out. 

“WitchHands (spelled WitchHands  *NOT* "Witch Hands) is a Colorado based Deathrock / Gothic Rock band formed in 2016.
D-beat drums, chorus drenched guitars, and lyrics of melancholic poetry and righteous rage.
Originally inspired by the 80’s LA Deathrock and European goth rock scenes. Now blending it together with other outside influences for their own take on the genre.
They are entirely self-produced from tours, to merchandise, to online presence.”
