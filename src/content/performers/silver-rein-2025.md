description: "Silver Rein is a body of solo musical work by Ithaca-based singer songwriter, Sarah Green. Looped electric cello is layered over deep resonant found object beats with powerful sweeping vocals woven throughout. Her work explores loneliness, isolation, death, and depression against the landscape of an old yet familiar world."
seoDescription: "Silver Rein returns to Dark Castle Fest 2025! Ithaca-based cellist & composer merges Gothic, neofolk & neoclassical dark folk with haunting cello & powerful vocals."

Our first band confirmation should be no surprise if you were there to experience the beauty of her 2024 performance. Silver Rein won the hearts of the entire festival and impressed us so much we had her perform twice! So, of course, we had to bring her back again this year. Art such as this is something you’ll want to experience live for the collective emotion and believe us, it is powerful. 

Come see and feel for yourself!

Silver Rein is an Ithaca, New York based composer, vocalist and cellist creating electric, dark folk. The sound has been described by listeners as “medieval Celtic” “atmospheric, Viking dungeon music” “cinematic” “good witch energy” and “a spiritual experience.”
