Dark Castle Fest will bring a rare opportunity to see the 1925 Italian epic Maciste In Hell (Maciste all’inferno) on a large video screen with a modern curated soundtrack. This is an experience you don’t want to miss.

This film is incredible with full armies of devils, stunning costumes, hand tinted film to provide an early attempt at color. It’s almost hard to believe it was filmed a hundred years ago.

Set to a contemporary music score and edited with easy to read English text for clarity, this is an experience you will always remember!

Join us on Thursday, September 26th • tickets available through the Dark Castle Fest website!
