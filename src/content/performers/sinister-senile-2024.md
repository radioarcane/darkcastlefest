Louisville local Sinister Senile will be joining us again in 2024!
Every adventure needs a good Mage and when it comes to spell casting, there’s none more reliable than our brother Kensaku Nishizato.

Sinister Senile is an evolving experimental project with a dark electro-accoustc edge.
Utilizing whatever each spell calls for, from tape loops to plinking and plunking away on a banjo used as a percussion instrument.
The project was founded in 1997 by artist Kensaku Nishizato. It has involved live works with Pas Musique, along with contributions by Norman Westberg (Swans) and others.
Since 1986, Kensaku has collaborated with Nurse With Wound, Val Denham, and more.

It’s almost hard to confine this music to “Dark” Ambient when this Dungeon Master weaves in so many gems, sparkles and fluorescent plastic dinosaurs.
Why not take a ride with Kensaku and friends and you tell us! Is it Dark Ambient, Avant-Garde, Dungeon Synth, New Age?

Maybe it’s just fun and you should check it out on Bandcamp or wherever you choose to listen to music. You can discover this treasure on all of the usual platforms.
Welcome back to Dark Castle Sinister Senile, we’re excited about you!
