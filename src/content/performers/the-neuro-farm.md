The Neuro Farm is a darkwave gothic rock band based in Washington DC. Combining vocal harmony with soaring violin melodies, driving rhythm guitar, and ethereal sonic textures, their music has been described as hauntingly beautiful. The Neuro Farm draws on influences such as Joy Division, Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Sigur Ros, Chelsea Wolfe, Portishead, and Rammstein. Full length discography includes “Vampyre” (2021), “The Descent” (2019), and “Ghosts” (2014).



The Neuro Farm puts on a delightfully dark, dreamy, and energetic performance. Their live shows have been covered by the Washington Post Going Out Guide, Brightest Young Things, DC Music Reviews, Hometown Sounds, and Metro Music. Their music has been featured on WMUC 88.1FM (Washington, DC), WOWD-LP 94.3FM (Takoma Park, MD), WERA 96.7FM (Washington DC), WRIR 97.3FM (Richmond, VA), Asalto Mata Radio Rock radio station (Spain), Radio ProRock (Poland), Subculture Shock, and Dark Nation Radio. The Neuro Farm has been twice nominated for “Best Rock Group” by the Washington DC Wammie Awards, and have been interviewed by Procession Magazine, WRIR 97.3FM, Gothic 2-Step, Another Wasted Hour, and reviewed by Procession Magazine, Sounds and Shadows, Alchemical Records, and Divide and Conquer Music.



The Neuro Farm members include Brian Wolff (guitar, vocal), Rebekah Feng (violin, vocal), DreamrD (drums), and Tim Phillips (synth).
