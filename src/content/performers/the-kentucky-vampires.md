The Kentucky Vampires are an unapologetically Gothic Rock band with roots in the city of Louisville, Kentucky.



They deliver eloquent lyrics and dramatic instrumentals about ancient times, sinister love, acts of sorcery and dark romance and are a part of the revival of Gothic Rock in its evolved contemporary forms while remaining true to the roots of traditional gothic origins.



Soon after creating their first album in 2018, they were signed to Secret Sin Records in 2019, after which they began work on their second album “Crimson Curse” released in 2020. The band sort of ended up on uncertain hiatus after the pandemic with members separating a bit to pursue other projects and personal lives but new material is currently in development with a future release not far away. While live performances will remain rare for the time being, Dark Castle 2023 will be a welcome back party for Louisville’s own, original Gothic Rock torchbearers.
