I suppose it’s somewhat expected that we’re gonna play this festival again.
Hope y’all don’t mind!

Motuvius Rex is a Gothic Folk Rock band from Louisville, Kentucky.

What started as a solo studio offshoot of The Kentucky Vampires has evolved into what is currently a five member, old school, live music focused performing act.
Rooted in Gothic culture but with a somewhat idiosyncratic, esoteric rural perspective.
