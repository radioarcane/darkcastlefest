The Kentucky Vampires will be returning for Dark Castle Fest 2024!
Last year was so much fun, we couldn’t resist another round.

The Kentucky Vampires are a four member Gothic Rock band with roots in the city of Louisville, Kentucky. They deliver dramatic songs about ancient times, acts of sorcery and dark romance. Helping to spread the revival of Gothic Rock in its evolved contemporary form while remaining true to the origins of traditional Gothic Rock history.
Soon after creating their first self titled album in 2018, they began work on their second album “Crimson Curse” released in 2020.

The band ended up on uncertain hiatus after the pandemic with members separating a bit to pursue other projects and personal endeavors but new material is in development with a future release not far away.

While live performances will remain rare for the time being, Dark Castle Fest began a new era for Louisville’s own original Gothic Rock torchbearers.
Check out The Kentucky Vampires on Bandcamp or wherever you choose to listen to music. They can be found on all of the usual platforms.
