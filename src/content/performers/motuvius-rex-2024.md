It’s likely no surprise that some of us local dwellers of the Dark Castle grand hall are going to play the festival again. We’ve got some new names but also a couple of returning performers. Art Sanctuary is, after all, our home and Dark Castle is a local celebration as well as bringing in internationally known acts.
We like to prove that Kentucky has its own unique voice in dark music and culture and a lot more creativity than we often get credit for. Louisville Gothic and Art Sanctuary have kept interesting things happening here for a couple of decades, now.
Yes, we want to show it off a bit: our home and our art.
So, let’s start with what’s basically our house band: Motuvius Rex. We pretty much live at Art Sanctuary anyway. From bartending to performing to just hanging out, Art Sanctuary is our clubhouse, we love it and we hope you will, too.

Motuvius Rex is a Gothic Folk band, for the most part. A bit of Psychedelic Rock, a dash of Appalachian music and mixed with a lot of influences from Boy George and the New Romantics to Genesis P-Orridge’s hippie cult music experiments. Throw in Merle Haggard, Christian Death, Current 93, Antônio Carlos Jobim etc, etc. All of this mixed with deep roots in Gothic Rock, New Wave and Neofolk music. Folk Noir? Not really. Gothic Rock? Probably some. Gothic Folk? That’s probably as close as it gets.
Art School weirdness with a rural life experience that still keeps a firm hold within a Gothic framework.
Basically, making Gothic Rock with a lot more acoustic instruments, which does include mandolins at times as well as antiquated electronics like a 1983 Casiotone Mt-65 and a 1988 Alesis HR-16 drum machine. All mixed with a full live band.

Based in Louisville, Kentucky, Motuvius Rex has performed and contributed bass for The Kentucky Vampires, as well as releasing music as Motuvius Rex. Currently signed with InClub Records in Lima, Peru. Motuvius Rex is also a founding member of the Dark Eclectic Music collective - Radio Arcane, also headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky.
