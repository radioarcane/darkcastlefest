Our dear Count has been lurking in the shadows of Louisville’s dark music scene since 2005.

After getting their start under the tutelage of Louisville Gothic’s founding members the Count has gone on to spread his abysmal vision via various dark dance nights and concerts across the city.

In addition to keeping the gothic and industrial scene festering in Louisville, Count Grozny spread his vile tendrils regionally, infecting Indianapolis, Bloomington, Nashville, Dayton, Cincinnati and Columbus.

Count Grozny is currently a resident DJ and promoter associated with the Radio Arcane organization as well as being one of the founders of Dark Castle Fest.
