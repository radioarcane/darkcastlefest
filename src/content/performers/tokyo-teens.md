Tokyo Teens are an 80’s inspired Darkpop band from Atlanta. Self described as “modern and dark with a slice of hope.”
Featuring songwriter, multi instrumentalist, and vocalist Jimmi B. and vocals, guitar, keys, and production by Grammy winning producer Billy Hume. Their live performances also include the addition of a second guitarist and live keyboardist and we are looking forward to seeing and meeting them at Dark Castle Fest.

Tokyo Teens released their first two tastefully well crafted and produced singles in late 2022 and a third in 2023.
Their songs have a feel good vibe and attractive melodies, even when moping in forlorn glumness. It’s a formula not unknown to bands like The Cure, New Order etc. who often made maudlin lyrics feel delightful.

We’re looking forward to them producing more and hopefully soon. In the meantime, you can check out Tokyo Teens on Bandcamp or wherever you choose to listen to music.
They can be found on all of the usual platforms, so, keep an eye out for new releases.
Welcome to Dark Castle Tokyo Teens, we’re excited about you!
