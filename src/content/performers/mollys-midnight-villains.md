Some of our local hedge witches are coming out of the woods to join us in our shadowed corridors this year and we couldn’t be more excited to have them aboard. It is our pleasure to welcome Molly’s Midnight Villains to Dark Castle Fest 2024!

Molly's Midnight Villains is a witchy alt-folk duo from Louisville - smoky vocals, lightning quick acoustic shred, and lyrics that will cast a spell on you.
Their most recent album, The Witch Folk Codex, was released in October of 2023. It's an esoteric collection of songs about magic, cryptids, and monsters.
You can check out Molly’s Midnight Villains on Bandcamp or wherever you choose to listen to music. Plenty of great tunes available on all of the usual platforms.
(Including our new Dark Castle Fest 2024 Spotify Playlist with all of the bands).

Welcome to Dark Castle Molly’s Midnight Villains, we’re excited about you!
