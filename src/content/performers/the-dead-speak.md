“If Ouija boards played music.”
The Dead Speak is a Louisville, Kentucky-based horror cow-beret duo that invoke goth rockabilly energy. Jaime Muerte (she/her) and Wayne Robinson (he/him) fuse guttural, impassioned vocals with stories centering around themes of suicide, folklore and substance abuse.
This band has built themselves a nice following and continues to grow and it seems wise to go ahead and let the dead speak for themselves. We wouldn’t want to interfere with this seance they have going.

“In The Dead Speak 'universe,' we like to say that Wayne and I are just conduits, or messengers, for the dead - and each song is someone else telling their story through us. Sometimes the songs are fun and pick on horror tropes, and sometimes they’re a lot more serious and personal. I think the common theme though is that we believe that as humans we need to get better at facing our fears. That through looking darkness in the eye and talking about it, we find the path to growth and light.” - Jamie Muerte
