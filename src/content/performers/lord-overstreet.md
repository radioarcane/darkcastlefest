The Lord's songs vary widely in style from blues to psychedelic rock to full-scale powerviolence - all while keeping a distinctly idiosyncratic level of soul and romance."

When first exposed to the frequencies of Lord Overstreet, the instant reaction was- “what deep, old time magick is this?”
The first listen was “Interloper” and “Woods” and the admiration was instant to lyric, song and vibe.
Like stumbling upon the ruins of an old abandoned house, an old medicine bottle half buried in dirt from a time long gone.
Like an old ghost.
