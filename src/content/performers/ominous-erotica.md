Ominous Erotica began in 1994 as Louisville, KY based artist; William J. Butler, set out to do a solo project including singing, all instrumentation, and recording. The concept was to be eerie, vampire themed, with a bondage concept that included audio clips from many vampire films.



The first full length project was recorded on an eigh track recorder. The song ideas were admirable, but being new to the process, the execution was poor.



The project continued and new material was made. It was clear that it was falling into its niche and became more somber, relationship themed, and S&M took a back seat.



The first realease: “Lips of Deceipt” was made available on cassette in 1996. It was fairly well received locally, and the live performance drove home the interest. A theatrical one man show including, victorian style, makeup, dancing, vinyl clad dancers, keyboard, guitars, TV video vusuals, an outlandish light show and enough fog to blind ones vision.



The project moved forward, and in 1998 the second released “Somber Embrace, Hollow Decline” was made available on cassette. This was a refined version of the project, and the pinical of its creation. It was locally very popular and made it's way into dance clubs in a few select states.



The final released was a reworking of the first  written tracks called: “The Night”, which was also put out on cassette in 1999.



A 10 reunion show was put on in 2008. Another in 2018, followed by one in 2022. The show is still very theatrical, with lights and dancers, but has moved from makeup to a masquerade theme.
