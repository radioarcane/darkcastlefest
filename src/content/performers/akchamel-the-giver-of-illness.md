As artists ourselves, we keep our eyes out for the unique and out of the ordinary. That’s how we’ve ended up with violins, cellos, banjos and bongo drums in a music scene dominated by trends we’ve continued to step outside of. There’s more to this darkly romantic community than the next post punk sensation and we wanna keep exploring that.

Dark Castle Fest is overjoyed to announce “Ak’chamel - The Giver Of Illness”.

To be frank, we’re not entirely sure what to expect. They look incredible and once explored musically it was time to invite these cats to Louisville. Sounding as if Martin Denny made a desert pilgrimage on ayahuasca or some other wildly grown psychedelic. Looking like… I know our photographers will surely have a blast shooting these guys. For a better perspective on this it’s time to cut and paste a quote from better writers.

“Few bands are as inscrutable as the mysterious Texas duo Ak’chamel. The pair are known for their countless cassettes, films, and full-length records (such as the publicly and critically acclaimed ‘The Totemist’), as well as for performing their ritualistic sounds in homespun costumes with self-made instruments.”<br />
