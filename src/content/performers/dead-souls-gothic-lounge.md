Dead Souls Gothic Lounge is the creation of Indianapolis-based DJs Gomez and Naggaroth and started in 2019 out of Chapel Hill, North Carolina. It would differentiate itself from other nights by being all-ages, showcasing a wide variety of music under the goth umbrella including lesser-known artists from South America and eastern Europe, and featuring a clothing and book swap at every event. Dead Souls would continue in North Carolina until the pandemic forced it to become online-only. In 2022, having relocated to Indianapolis, Naggaroth and Gomez resurrected Dead Souls live events at the music venue Healer. Today it continues to provide a unique and inclusive alternative music experience each month.
