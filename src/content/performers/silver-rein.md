description: "Silver Rein is a body of solo musical work by Ithaca-based singer songwriter, Sarah Green. Looped electric cello is layered over deep resonant found object beats with powerful sweeping vocals woven throughout. Her work explores loneliness, isolation, death, and depression against the landscape of an old yet familiar world."

We’re very excited to introduce this next confirmation because, quite honestly, it’s just refreshing to hear live cello in a Gothic framework right now.
We know it's not the first or only dark project to utilize classical instruments but it is sweet to hear them done well to a minimalist palette like in decades past. This music actually feels within the traditions of Gothic Expressionism, Post Industrial, Neofolk and Neoclassical music and it’s not been over polished or sterilized for a more commercial appeal; praise the gods. It was wonderful to hear and an instant attraction.

It’s not just the cello, either. The electronics meld tastefully to enhance the songs but never overpower them. There is also tremendous vocal ability that we can only assume has some classical training. A powerful voice and true understanding of harmony.

Silver Rein is an Ithaca, New York based composer, vocalist and cellist creating electric, dark folk.
The sound has been described by listeners as “medieval Celtic” “atmospheric, Viking dungeon music” “cinematic” “good witch energy” and “a spiritual experience.”

Check this project out on Bandcamp or wherever you choose to listen to music.

Silver Rein is finishing a new album due out this Spring and current singles can be found on all the usual platforms.
Anyway, welcome to Dark Castle Silver Rein, we're excited about you!
