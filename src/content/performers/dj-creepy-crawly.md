Creepy Crawly is owner, DJ and curator for Fermenteddarkness Radio out of the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania.
There’s not a more supportive DJ in the dark music community and we appreciate his all seeing eye.

Creepy Crawly’s beginnings go as far back as the early ‘90s as a club promoter in New York City. He later moved to Savannah, Georgia in 2003 where he created new goth nights and hosted some great bands such as The Last Dance and Crüxshadows. He has served as a guest DJ in North Carolina and Endless Night in New Orleans.

These days, he mostly just makes us bands happy by including us in his set lists like Hex Signs or delighting listeners with Echos Of Yesterday on Fermenteddarkness Radio.
We’re looking forward to seeing Creepy Crawly in person and excited to have him spin for our castle ballroom. We’re gonna hang out and have a blast and you can too!
Until then, you can check out Creepy Crawly’s Fermenteddarkness Radio shows on Mixcloud and follow his sets on Facebook and Instagram; where he never fails to list bands.
Welcome to Dark Castle DJ Creepy Crawly, we’re excited about you!
