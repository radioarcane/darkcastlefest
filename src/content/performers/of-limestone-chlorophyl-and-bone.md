Perhaps the most interesting thing about Dark Castle Fest that makes us a bit unique is that we are a ragtag band of lifelong struggling artists. We’re a weird, often uncomfortable and sometimes chaotic bunch of creative misfits. One thing we all love here though, is this strange land called Kentucky. It’s ancient, fossilized, sometimes backwards but more often than not beautiful. When we look beyond the flawed human elements, we see the natural wonder here and revere it.

One of our family mystics has turned his visionary wonders into wearable art and it is absolutely stunning. Last year he brought us our castle denizen “Babacastillo” (if you were there, you know). Babacastillo will return this year as well, more flamboyant than ever, and this time, she brings us her entire castle court to grace our halls with a full blown fashion show! This, you do not want to miss! I’ll end this long-winded elucidation here and let the artist speak for himself:

“Of Limestone, Chlorophyll, and Bone” is a wearable art experience that explores the ancient land we know as Kentucky. From the roaring waterways to its deep winding caverns. From the abundance of poisonous plants, to the vast network of fungus that is deeply rooted in its mineral rich soil. The inspiration is the land, the flora, and the fauna.
In collaboration with various artists and models, “Of Limestone, Chlorophyll, and Bone” is designer Edwin Ramirez’s debut runway collection.
