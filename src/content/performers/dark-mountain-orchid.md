After years on the fringes of the vibrant East Tennessee music scene, Leslie Abney put together Dark Mountain Orchid in 2002, releasing “Luxury of Sin” three years later. On record, she’s a siren who croons, coos and pleads for the darkness to abate. A witch of the woods decanting a cauldron of desire over smoldering coals. A ghost trapped between the world that was and the one that is now, marveling at the beauty laid bare by desolation. Live, she was a force of nature whose Appalachian Gothic style was as bold as her songs."

Keeping with our appreciation for live instrumentation and styles that go beyond the standard fare; Dark Castle Fest is plum tickled to be able to include some real Appalachian folk magic from East Tennessee’s Dark Mountain Orchid as part of this year’s festival!

Dark Mountain Orchid is a full, six member band complete with enchanting vocals and excellent musicianship. 

“After years on the fringes of the vibrant East Tennessee music scene, Leslie Abney put together Dark Mountain Orchid in 2002, releasing “Luxury of Sin” three years later.
On record, she’s a siren who croons, coos and pleads for the darkness to abate. A witch of the woods decanting a cauldron of desire over smoldering coals. A ghost trapped between the world that was and the one that is now, marveling at the beauty laid bare by desolation. Live, she was a force of nature whose Appalachian Gothic style was as bold as her songs.
And then she disappeared.
Now, two decades later, she’s returned with a new album – “Thrall” – and a new band. It’s a collection that chronicles her journey, and the “thralls” that found her along the way, those creatures who seize the soul to feed and whose talons become roots as they drain victims of light, life and love. She has, however, emerged stronger and more certain than ever of the path she’s on, and she’s assembled a band that rises to meet the talent she’s long possessed.”
