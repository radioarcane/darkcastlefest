Count Grozny has been lurking in the shadows of Louisville's dark music scene since 2005. After getting their start under the tutelage of Louisville Gothic's founding members the Count would go on to spread his abysmal vision via various dark dance nights and concerts across the city.

In addition to keeping the gothic and industrial scene festering in Louisville, Count Grozny spread his vile tendrils regionally, infecting Indianapolis, Bloomington, Nashville, Dayton, Cincinnati and Columbus.

Count Grozny is currently a resident DJ and promoter associated with the sinister “Radio Arcane” organization and one of the founders of the Dark Castle Festival.
