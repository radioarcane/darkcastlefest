Pale Moon Tattoo is shining some moon glow on Dark Castle Fest with sponsorship! We’re plum thrilled to have these incredible artists join us. If you need some ink, Pale Moon has a whole lot of talent. Heck, one of their guys did most of mine and it’s probably time to get some more.

Pale Moon Tattoo was founded by artists and husband and wife Ryan and Alexandra Rumsey. Seeing a need for a safe and inclusive environment for their then co-workers and now independent contractors they opened Pale Moon to the public May of 2020 in the height of the global pandemic.

Pale Moon has eight tattoo artists all specializing in different styles of tattooing and artwork. They frequently host tattoo flash specials, and have participated in several charitable tattoo events and art auctions.
