Dark Castle Fest is honored to be working with The HIVE, Inc this year!

Hailing from the marvelous realm of Bowling Green, Kentucky, these busy bees are all about community. Ultimately, that’s what a festival is all about, right? Sharing an experience, getting in the creative zone and celebrating life.
The HIVE is very special to Art Sanctuary.
More than just one nonprofit to another, these folks are family.
