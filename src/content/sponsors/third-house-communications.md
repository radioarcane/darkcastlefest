description: "Third House Communications is a boutique record label from Louisville KY, with a heavy focus on the darker corners of the music world. “Doom, punk, hardcore, industrial, minimal noise, metal, it all falls into our interests. Digging up lost gems from Louisville’s past, and the freshest cuts from around the world, putting it on wax in small runs.” Knowing these cats like we do, just gonna say you’re gonna want to keep an eye on this record label because it’s just getting fired up. It’s in the stars. Great things happening."

In astrology, your birth chart is divided into twelve sections called houses, and each house rules over different areas of life. The third house is called the House of Communication. Some astrologers may also refer to it as the House of Sharing.
In this case, Third House Communications is teaming up with Dark Castle Fest this year to help us communicate and share a common love of music.
