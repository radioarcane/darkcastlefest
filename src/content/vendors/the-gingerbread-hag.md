description: "We are very fortunate to have our friends at The Gingerbread Hag serving up delicious food and treats! They will also be indoors in the air conditioning with us and not out in the hot sun on the street like last year. How exciting is that? The Gingerbread Hag has been with us at The Dark Market for some time but more recently they have expanded from tasty cupcakes, cookies and sweets into serving up full meals during the Va Va Vixens sell out shows. We know they are reliable and they are good friends. They have it together, y’all. Not only is their food delicious but they are also every bit as sweet as people as their delicious treats. We love them and hope that you will, too!"
