               Pale Moon Tattoo was founded by artists and husband and wife Ryan
               and Alexandra Rumsey. Seeing a need for a safe and inclusive
               environment for their then co-workers and now independent
               contractors they opened Pale Moon to the public May of 2020 in
               the height of the global pandemic. Pale Moon has eight tattoo
               artists all specializing in different styles of tattooing and
               artwork. They frequently host tattoo flash specials, and have
               participated in several charitable tattoo events and art
               auctions.

               Third House Communications is a boutique record label from
               Louisville KY, with a heavy focus on the darker corners of the
               music world. “Doom, punk, hardcore, industrial, minimal noise,
               metal, it all falls into our interests. Digging up lost gems from
               Louisville’s past, and the freshest cuts from around the world,
               putting it on wax in small runs.” Knowing these cats like we do,
               just gonna say you’re gonna want to keep an eye on this record
               label because it’s just getting fired up. It’s in the stars.
               Great things happening.
