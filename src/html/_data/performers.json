This time the band elicited the expertise of J. Robbins (Jawbox, Burning Airlines) at Baltimore’s renowned Magpie Cage Studio who recorded and helped produce Talking to Shadows’ forthcoming sophomore effort set to be released sometime in 2023."

            "text": "In January of 2022, singer/songwriter Chrys J began writing new songs out of love and admiration for his earlier art school days in Chapel Hill, NC. In college he discovered punk and metal but it was the darker side of the sound spectrum that really enamored him. Darkwave, post punk and goth rock mixtapes became his study guides and creative inspiration. He wandered in and out of several local indie bands as a guitarist and vocalist but it wasn’t until late 2021 that he began to put these new ideas to pen and paper. This new music started to combine dark angular post punk guitar with driving danceable drums and bass. He wrote quickly and recorded several demos that would see the light of day under his newly christened Chrysanthemum Ballroom bandcamp page. “Night Hope” was released in March, then the single and video for “Mirrorball Explodes” in May. The sound marries elements of early new wave, deathrock and darkwave with mystical lyrics and haunting themes. In late October Chrys released the single and video for “Trick of the Lights” and played his inaugural live show for a goth night in Lynchburg, Virginia. Chrysanthemum Ballroom will round out the year with an east coast run of shows in early December."

After each member played in several music acts over the last three decades, the foursome connected with a mutual love for post-punk and darkwave music of the 80s and 90s. After a few rehearsals and practices, Wireworks was ultimately created. Wireworks released their self-titled debut release in May of 2021 which featured nine songs of all out post-punk and darkwave music. Both catchy and going from shoegaze to upbeat, the band continued to grow and broaden their sound. In 2022, Jake Miller reached out to synth/keyboardist Paul Chenault to join the band. With the addition of ambient and dreamy synths, they released two singles “Please Forget Me” and “Strangers Again” showcasing the full ensemble. Wireworks recently released a cover version of “Just You” from the infamous Twin Peaks series through Darkness Calling compilation benefiting The Trevor Project. Wireworks is now currently completing recording on their sophomore release expected to be out in 2023."

Formed by Luis Navarro (vocals, guitar, synth, drum machines) and Joel Niño, Jr. (bass, synth, vocals) in 2017, the band gathers their influences from the period of the dark ‘80s. Darkwave, post-punk, and coldwave are genres that the band summon using analog synthesizers and drum machines; dark melodic sounds, lyrics of the undead, the occult, and parallel universes are what conjure Twin Tribes."

As true Cocteau Twins scholars they won’t play pop without the prefix “dream-” in front of it. Laying the groundwork for a new band in late 2020, the married couple wrote songs and developed their sound in quarantine at home for “when human interaction became a thing again.” An initial third member became convinced that Audrey and Nicholas were working for the CIA and running a sex cult (really), which almost left Faux Fear as a duo before the Philly-based Pra (he/him) answered a Craigslist ad and completed the picture on bass."

            "text": "Like their darkwave forebears, Faux Fear’s offerings like “Uncharted” and “Legacy” maintain a tricky balance between atmosphere and propulsion. The trio balances the stillness of reverberating specks of guitar with thick slabs of bass and drum machine as Audrey coolly explores the space between with her calmly intense vocal lines, smoothing over even the unexpectedly dissonant chorus of the latter and taking on a whole other dimension. “Code of the Sea” is as oceanic as its title and somewhat akin to folding the rippling waves of vintage Slowdive in with New Order’s most magnetic repetitive hooks."
